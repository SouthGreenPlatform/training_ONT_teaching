# Welcome on the training_ONT_teaching github repository of the Southgreen Bioinformatics Platform

Welcome to the nanopore training course "__Introduction to nanopore data analysis for Metavirome__".

This tutorial will guide you through the typical steps of exploration of metavirome using taxonomic assignation from reads or by assemblies.

In session 2022 (see 2022 branch), we have created a Virtual Machine **IFB Biosphere containing** all tools need to reproduce this training.

You can use our VM "**virus-ont**". Find it in the RAINBio catalogue: https://biosphere.france-bioinformatique.fr/catalogue/

Data used are hosted in a **i-Trop** server https://bioinfo.ird.fr/.

### Thanks

Thanks to i-Trop IRD plateform for support on docker VM creation and data stockage. 

Special thanks to IFB for support and availability of VM on Biosphere !
