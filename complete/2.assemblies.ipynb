    "More contiguous genome assemblies can be generated using long sequencing read but assembly is not a quiet pace. Eukaryotic genomes assembly is a complex task (large genome sizes, high rates of repeated sequences, high heterozygosity levels and even polyploidy). While prokaryotic genomes may appear less challenging, specific features such as circular DNA molecules, must be taken into consideration to achieve high quality assembly.\n",
